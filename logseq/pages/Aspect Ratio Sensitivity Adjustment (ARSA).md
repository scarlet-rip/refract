### Formula
	- The **Aspect Ratio Sensitivity Adjustment (ARSA)** adjusts the sensitivity based on the difference in aspect ratio between the original system's screen and the target system's screen.
	- $$
	  ARSA = \left( \frac{\text{target screen width}}{\text{target screen height}} \right) \div \left( \frac{\text{original screen width}}{\text{original screen height}} \right)
	  $$
- ### Parameters
	- `original screen width`: The width of the original system's screen resolution in pixels.
	- `original screen height`: The height of the original system's screen resolution in pixels.
	- `target screen width`: The width of the target system's screen resolution in pixels.
	- `target screen height`: The height of the target system's screen resolution in pixels.
- ### Explanation
	- **ARSA** adjusts sensitivity to account for differences in aspect ratio between the original system's screen and the target system's screen.
