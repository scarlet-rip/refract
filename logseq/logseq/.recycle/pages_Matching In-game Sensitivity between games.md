- $$
  \text{In-game Sensitivity (Game B)} = \frac{\text{Standardized Sensitivity (Game A)}}{\text{Standardized Sensitivity (Game B)}}
  $$
- **Standardized Sensitivity (Game A)**: The calculated base sensitivity for Game A, derived from the 360Â° Turn Distance and the game's mouse DPI and sensitivity.
- **Standardized Sensitivity (Game B)**: The calculated base sensitivity for Game B, similarly derived for that game.
  
  To match the sensitivity between **Game A** and **Game B**, divide the **Standardized Sensitivity (Game A)** by the **Standardized Sensitivity (Game B)**.
