  * # HTML web clipping
  * Hi, I am new logseq user who migrated from joplin. What I love about joplin is it's awesome web clipper. I can download the web page as markdown and in HTML too. Joplin nicely shows the html page but I can't do that logseq. I found about iframing but the html file won't be uploaded for sync though I can use a plugin to view a page by opening it in the slider which is not supported in android logseq app.
  * Any work around to view html page in logseq? I know android app doesn't support plugins yet but in the desktop app, it would be nice.
